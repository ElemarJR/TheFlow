Examples of how to use it are available at http://www.elemarjr.com/en/serie/introducing-theflow/

## Installing
TheFlow is available as a NuGet package. You can simple install it using:

```
Install-Package TheFlow
```

## Use cases
TheFlow makes easier the implementation of a "Process-Driven Architecture." 

To get started I would like to propose "TheFlow" as a [Saga Execution Manager](http://www.elemarjr.com/en/serie/introducing-theflow/).
